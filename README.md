## Project Description

This project is a role-based authentication system built with Laravel and Laravel Breeze. It supports multiple user roles (such as patient, tandarts, mondhygienist, assistent, and praktijkmanagement) and provides secure registration, login, logout, and password reset functionality. Each user role has its own dashboard and permissions, ensuring that users only access pages relevant to their role.

### Features

-   User registration and authentication
-   Role-based access control for dashboards and features
-   Individual homepages for each user role
-   Admins can access all dashboards
-   Password reset and session management

### Expectations

-   Users can register and log in with their credentials
-   After login, users are redirected to their role-specific dashboard
-   Only authorized users can access protected routes
-   Admins have permission to view all dashboards
-   The system is secure, customizable, and ready for further development

This setup provides a solid foundation for building more advanced user management and feature access in a Laravel application.
